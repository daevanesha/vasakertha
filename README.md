This personal project was 100% developed using AI (Sonnet and GPT models) due to my zero programming experience. It's an integrator app that run locally with FastAPI backend, PostGreSQL database and TypeScript frontend.
Version 2 include : Dashboard, Provider Menu, Model Menu and Discord Integration Menu. Tested on my Discord channel, the bot supports multiple API key providers like OpenRouter, provides contextual responses by remembering each user's 10 most recent prompts, and allows interaction between multiple models. 
Each model features a unique personality through implemented behavioral layers.
