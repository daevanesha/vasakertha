# DaeAI Iteration Log

This file records the development journey, decisions, and changes made to the DaeAI project. It is intended to help any future developer or AI Agent understand the context, history, and rationale behind the evolution of this app.

---

## [2025-05-12] Iteration Logging Initiated

- At the user's request, created this ITERATION_LOG.txt file to document all significant actions, changes, and lessons learned during development.
- Purpose: To provide transparency, context, and a reference for future contributors or AI Agents, especially as the project grows more complex.

---

## [2025-05-12] Recent Key Actions

- Modularized backend routers for Providers, Models, and Bots.
- Set up Git version control and added .gitattributes to handle line endings and silence CRLF/LF warnings.
- Implemented regular checkpoints after major UI/UX or backend changes.
- Improved sidebar navigation: grouped Provider/Model under "AI Management" and Bot Manager under "Discord Management".
- Cleaned up sidebar by removing unnecessary separators and submenu icons.
- Enhanced Discord bot: replaced !ping with !status, which now returns bot name, ID, version (from git), and creator ("Daevaesma") as a Discord embed card.
- Improved Model and Provider pages: added column reordering, parameter/behavior display, and behavior truncation with tooltip.
- All major UI/UX changes are checkpointed in Git for safe rollback.

---

## [2025-05-12] Added Bot-Model Integration Table

- Added a new SQLAlchemy model/table `BotModelIntegration` to support many-to-many relationships between Discord bots and AI models, with a custom command for each integration (e.g., !askdesi).
- This enables each bot to integrate with multiple models, each triggered by a unique command, as part of the new Discord Management feature.
- No changes to existing functionality; this is a safe foundation for the new integration feature.

---

## [2025-05-12] Modular Bot-Model Integration API

- Added modular Pydantic schemas for BotModelIntegration in `schemas/schemas.py`.
- Created a new modular router `routers/bot_model_integrations.py` with CRUD endpoints for managing bot-model-command integrations.
- Registered the new router in `main.py` to keep the API modular and regression-resistant.
- All changes are isolated and do not affect existing features, minimizing regression risk.

---

## [2025-05-12] Bot Model Integration UI Enhancements

- Added an "Integrate Models" button in the BotManager page for each bot.
- Created a new route and page for managing bot-model integrations.
- Button navigates to a dedicated page where users can add/remove model integrations with custom commands.
- Maintained modular and clean UI/UX design.

---

## [2025-05-12] Bot Model Integration UI Completed

- Successfully added "Integrate Models" button to each bot row in the BotManager page.
- Created a dedicated route and page (`/bots/:botId/integrations`) for managing bot-model integrations.
- Implemented frontend logic to navigate to integration management page.
- Backend and frontend components are now fully integrated for managing bot-model relationships.
- Maintained modular and clean UI/UX design across the application.

---

## [2025-05-12] Discord Bot !status Command Card Update

- Updated the !status command to return a Discord embed card matching the new D.AI style: title "D.AI", Bot ID in a code block, Version and Creator fields, and the bot's avatar as a thumbnail.
- Removed the !ping command as requested.
- This change improves clarity and branding for bot status responses in Discord.

---

## [2025-05-12] v1.0-multiprovider-stable: Full Multi-Provider Discord Bot Integration Stable Checkpoint

- All major AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral) are now fully supported in the Discord bot backend, with correct API request/response handling per official docs.
- Dynamic command registration for each bot-model-command integration, robust error handling, and prevention of misconfiguration in the UI.
- Fixed all known issues with provider/model routing, error feedback, and API parameter usage (e.g., DeepSeek model_id).
- Stable, production-ready checkpoint. Tag: v1.0-multiprovider-stable

---

## [2025-05-12] Injected persona/behavior support for all AI providers in bot_manager.py. The bot now checks the model's configuration for a 'behavior' or 'persona' key and injects it as a system message (or equivalent) for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Mistral. This ensures the AI responds according to the configured persona. No errors after change. Stable checkpoint.

---

## [2025-05-12] Github checkpoint: Persona/behavior injection is now working for all AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral) in the Discord bot backend. The bot now respects the configured persona for each model. Stable and tested. ðŸŽ‰

---

# Iteration Log - May 12, 2025

- Enhancement: The !status command now displays the "Creator" field at the bottom of the embed for improved visual layout and clarity.
- All previous improvements (multi-provider integration, persona/behavior injection, buffer message, error handling, status reporting, and Discord embed UX) are confirmed stable and working as intended.
- No outstanding tasks. System is ready for monitoring and future enhancements.
- Git commit checkpoint created after this log.

---

# Iteration Log - v1.2 (2025-05-13)

- Refactored !status command:
  - Removed bot ID from status card.
  - Changed "Creator Daevaesma" to "Develop by Daevaesma" and moved to footer.
  - Added "General Commands" section below "Integrated Commands", listing only !status and !devinfo.
  - Removed !help from general commands list.
- Implemented !devinfo command:
  - Card titled "Development Information".
  - Displays current bot version (from git tag/commit).
  - Shows checklist of last 10 git commit messages (auto-updating from git log).
  - Truncates checklist if it exceeds Discord's 1024-character embed field limit.
  - Footer: "Develop by Daevaesma | auto-generated from git log".
- Both version and checklist in !devinfo auto-update with git history.
- Created stable checkpoint commit and tagged as v1.2 in git.

---

## [2025-05-14] Major Model Info, Image, and Discord Bot Enhancements

- Added per-user, per-model short-term memory to Discord bot model commands for improved context retention.
- Implemented `!models` command in the Discord bot to display all available models/personas with info, status, and image thumbnails.
- Updated backend models, schemas, and API endpoints to support `short_description`, `tags` (with validation, max 5), `active/inactive` status, and `image_url` fields for models.
- Added image upload endpoint and static file serving for model images; ensured backend always returns absolute URLs for images.
- Updated frontend (AI Model Page) to allow editing model descriptions, tags, status, and uploading/displaying images. Improved tag input and status chip UI/UX.
- Ensured model images display correctly in both the web UI and Discord bot info cards (with fallback and logging).
- Fixed CORS configuration to use a valid list for `allow_origins`.
- Ran and removed migration scripts after confirming DB schema updates (including `image_url` column).
- Cleaned up workspace: removed test images, migration scripts, utility scripts, and all `__pycache__` folders.
- Created a git checkpoint for this iteration.

**Next Steps:**
- (Optional/future) Deploy backend or use public image hosting for Discord image support in production.
- Continue refining UI/UX and model management features as needed.

## [2025-05-14] v1.4 Checkpoint â€” Tag Removal, !models Card Update, and Error Fixes

- Fully removed all tag functionality and UI from both frontend and backend (Dashboard, Models page, Discord bot, API, and schemas).
- Updated the Discord bot's !models command card: removed status, added provider, model name, and temperature fields.
- Changed the embed footer to: "Model provided by API*".
- Fixed all TypeScript and compile errors in the frontend (api.ts, Models.tsx, etc.).
- Created a git checkpoint and tagged as v1.4.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue refining model management and Discord integration features as needed.
- Use this checkpoint as a stable baseline for future development.

---

## [2025-05-14] v1.5 Checkpoint â€” Frontend API Response Fixes

- Fixed frontend to handle both array and object responses from /models/ and /providers/ endpoints.
- Restored dashboard and data display after previous breaking change.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue to monitor for any further API/response mismatches.
- Use this checkpoint as a stable baseline for further UI/UX improvements.
