1. Add OpenRouter as a Distinct Provider
In your Provider menu, add OpenRouter as a new provider entry (just like OpenAI or DeepSeek).
Store its API key and endpoint as usual.
2. Distinguish OpenRouter Models in the Models Menu
When adding a model and the provider is OpenRouter, fetch the list of available models from OpenRouter’s API.
When saving a model, store an extra field (e.g., is_openrouter: true or source: 'openrouter') to mark it as an OpenRouter model.
Optionally, display a badge or label in your Models menu and dashboard to indicate “OpenRouter Model”.
3. Backend/API Handling
When sending requests, check if the model is from OpenRouter (using the extra field) and route the API call to OpenRouter’s endpoint with the correct model ID and API key.
For other providers, keep your existing logic.
4. User Experience
In the UI, you can show OpenRouter models grouped or labeled, so users know which models are from OpenRouter.
This keeps your system organized and avoids confusion.
